This is a project based on the course Software Performance Engineering - COSC 5P07

# Overview
This project is a study that focus on determining the patterns that arise in the benchmark data generated in the [research work](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-022-10247-x) by Traini et. al (2022).
Our goal is to extract meaningful features from the data, examine the pattern amongst the features and
identify which of them effectively impact the state of a benchmark. We propose and answer some research questions that projects us to achieving the goal of this study.

We employed the Python programming language and libraries like numpy, pandas and seaborn to finding
answers to our research questions.
